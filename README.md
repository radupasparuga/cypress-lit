# cypress-lit

A cypress with lit example that works for component testing.

## Usage

```
pnpm install

pnpm run cypress
```

## Setup

To do this in your project follow the component test wizard for cypress, I recommend selecting svelte - but skip installing that framework.

After that you can add the mount command I have written [./cypress/support/lit/index.t](./cypress/support/lit/index.ts)
